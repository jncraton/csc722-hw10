Lecture Example
===============

Before we jump into the problem set, let's replicate a result from lecture to confirm our understanding.

    f(x) = c(1-x)
    x = [0,1]

Finding c
---------

We know that our total probabilty will always be 1, so we can exploit this find the value of `c` which satisfied this property.

```python,results='tex'
c,x = symbols('c x')

f = c*(1-x)
bounds = (x,0,1)

c_val = solve(integrate(f,bounds) - 1)[0]

print(c_val)
```

This lines up with the result from lecture.

Now we can plug this back into our original expression:

```python,results='tex'
f = f.subs(c, c_val)

tex(f)
```

Expected Value
--------------

Recall that:

$E(x) = \int xf(x)dx$

We can solve this easily enough:

```python,results='tex'
integrate(x*f,bounds)
```

We see that this also matches the lecture.

Variance
--------

Recall the following expression for variance:

$Var(x) = E(x^2) - E(x)^2$

Let's take that one piece at a time and find $E(x^2)$ first:

$E(x^2) = \int x^2f(x)dx$

```python
integrate(x**2*f,bounds)
```

Nice. We already know $E(x)$, so now we just put this together:

```python
integrate(x**2*f,bounds) - integrate(x*f,bounds)**2
```

This matches the result from lecture. Now let's just do this a bunch more times.

Problem 1
=========

$f(x) = cx^2$
    
$x = [0,2]$ 

Part A
------

> Find c 

We know that our total probabilty will always be 1, so we can exploit this find the value of `c` which satisfied this property.

```python,results='tex'
f = c*x**2
bounds = (x,0,2)

c_val = solve(integrate(f,bounds) - 1)[0]

print(c_val)
```

Now we can plug this back into our original expression:

```python,results='tex'
f = f.subs(c, c_val)

tex(f)
```

Part B
------

> Find E(X) 

Recall that:

$E(x) = \int xf(x)dx$

We can solve this easily enough:

```python,results='tex'
integrate(x*f,bounds)
```

Part C
------

> Find Var(X) 

Recall the following expression for variance:

$Var(x) = E(x^2) - E(x)^2$

Let's take that one piece at a time and find $E(x^2)$ first:

$E(x^2) = \int x^2f(x)dx$

```python
integrate(x**2*f,bounds)
```

We already know $E(x)$, so now we just put this together:

```python
integrate(x**2*f,bounds) - integrate(x*f,bounds)**2
```

Problem 2
=========

$f(x) = c e^{-2x}$

$x = [0,infinity]$ 

Part A
------

> Find c 

We know that our total probabilty will always be 1, so we can exploit this find the value of `c` which satisfied this property.

```python,results='tex'
f = c*exp(-2*x)
bounds = (x,0,oo)

c_val = solve(integrate(f,bounds) - 1)[0]

print(c_val)
```

Now we can plug this back into our original expression:

```python,results='tex'
f = f.subs(c, c_val)

tex(f)
```

Part B
------

> Find E(X) 

Recall that:

$E(x) = \int xf(x)dx$

We can solve this easily enough:

```python,results='tex'
integrate(x*f,bounds)
```

Part C
------

> Find Var(X) 

This wasn't requested, but I'll calculate it anyway.

Recall the following expression for variance:

$Var(x) = E(x^2) - E(x)^2$

Let's take that one piece at a time and find $E(x^2)$ first:

$E(x^2) = \int x^2f(x)dx$

```python
integrate(x**2*f,bounds)
```

We already know $E(x)$, so now we just put this together:

```python
integrate(x**2*f,bounds) - integrate(x*f,bounds)**2
```

Problem 3
=========

$f(x) = c cos(2x)$

$x= [-pi/4  pi/4]$

Part A
------

> Find c 

We know that our total probabilty will always be 1, so we can exploit this find the value of `c` which satisfied this property.

```python,results='tex'
f = c*cos(2*x)
bounds = (x,-pi/4,pi/4)

c_val = solve(integrate(f,bounds) - 1)[0]

print(c_val)
```

Now we can plug this back into our original expression:

```python,results='tex'
f = f.subs(c, c_val)

tex(f)
```

Part B
------

> Find E(X) 

Recall that:

$E(x) = \int xf(x)dx$

We can solve this easily enough:

```python,results='tex'
integrate(x*f,bounds)
```

That makes intuitive sense simply by looking at the symmetry of the graph:

```python,results='hidden'
plot(x*f,bounds)
```

Part C
------

> Find Var(X) 

This wasn't requested, but I'll calculate it anyway.

Recall the following expression for variance:

$Var(x) = E(x^2) - E(x)^2$

Let's take that one piece at a time and find $E(x^2)$ first:

$E(x^2) = \int x^2f(x)dx$

```python
integrate(x**2*f,bounds)
```

We already know $E(x)$, so now we just put this together:

```python
integrate(x**2*f,bounds) - integrate(x*f,bounds)**2
```

Problem 4
=========

$f(x) = c/x$ 

$x = \{-2, -1, 1, 2\}$  (discrete random variable)

The theory is the same for a discrete RV.

Part A
------

> Find c 

We know that our total probabilty will always be 1, so we can exploit this find the value of `c` which satisfied this property. Previously, this involved solving an integral. This time it simply involves solving a sum.

```python,results='tex'
f = c/x
values = [-2,-1,1,2]

print([f.subs(x,v) for v in values])
```

This appears to be quite broken. We see a few issues:

1. The total probability is 0.
2. Several individual probabilities are negative.

The graph would be something like this:

```python,results='hidden'
plot(1/x,(x,-2,2))
```

We can see that no amount of scaling will produce a total probability of 1.

Problem 5
=========

$f(x) = c cos(x^2) + |x|

$x= [-1,1]$

Part A
------

Let's find `c` first.

We know that our total probabilty will always be 1, so we can exploit this find the value of `c` which satisfied this property.

```python,results='tex'
f = c*cos(x**2) + abs(x)
bounds = (x,-1,1)

tex(f)

c_val = solve(integrate(f,bounds) - 1)[0]

print(c_val)
```

Now we can plug this back into our original expression:

```python,results='tex'
f = f.subs(c, c_val)

tex(f)
```

We can see that the cosine term drops out completely. Let's plot this:

```python,results='tex'
plot(f,bounds)
```

> Find E(X) 

Recall that:

$E(x) = \int xf(x)dx$

We can solve this easily enough:

```python,results='tex'
integrate(x*f,bounds)
```

That makes intuitive sense simply by looking at the symmetry of the graph:

```python,results='hidden'
plot(x*f,bounds)
```

Problem 6
=========

$f(x) = c (1 â€“ x^2)$ 

$x= [-1, 1]$
 
Part A
------

Let's start by finding c.

We know that our total probabilty will always be 1, so we can exploit this find the value of `c` which satisfied this property.

```python,results='tex'
f = c*(1-x**2)
bounds = (x,-1,1)

c_val = solve(integrate(f,bounds) - 1)[0]

print(c_val)
```

Now we can plug this back into our original expression:

```python,results='tex'
f = f.subs(c, c_val)

tex(f)
```

Let's plot this:

```python,results='hidden'
plot(f,bounds)
```

> Find E(X) 

Recall that:

$E(x) = \int xf(x)dx$

We can solve this easily enough:

```python,results='tex'
integrate(x*f,bounds)
```

That makes intuitive sense simply by looking at the symmetry of the graph:

```python,results='hidden'
plot(x*f,bounds)
```

Part B
------

> Find Var(X) 

Recall the following expression for variance:

$Var(x) = E(x^2) - E(x)^2$

Let's take that one piece at a time and find $E(x^2)$ first:

$E(x^2) = \int x^2f(x)dx$

```python
integrate(x**2*f,bounds)
```

We already know $E(x)$, so now we just put this together:

```python
integrate(x**2*f,bounds) - integrate(x*f,bounds)**2
```
